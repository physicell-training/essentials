# PhysiCell Essentials Short Course
This short course is the place to start, whether new to modeling, planning serious models in PhysiCell, or preparing for more advanced C++ based customizations. We'll introduce agent-based modeling (and PhysiCell), and lead you through several hands-on exercises to create models, without need for coding.

The work can be done in a web browser or in PhysiCell Studio, and no background coding (or deep knowledge of biology) is required.
